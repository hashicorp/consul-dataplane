```release-note:feature
Added the ability to set the `-mode` flag. Options available are `sidecar` and `dns-proxy`. The system defaults to `sidecar`.
When set to `sidecar`:
- DNS Server, xDS Server, and Envoy are enabled.
- The system validates that `-consul-dns-bind-addr` and equivalent environment variable must be set to the loopback address.
When set to `dns-proxy`:
- Only DNS Server is enabled. xDS Server and Envoy are disabled.
- `consul-dns-bind-addr` and equivalent environment variable can be set to other values besides the loopback address.
