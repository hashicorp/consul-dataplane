```release-note:feature
Implemented a subcommand "check-proxy-health" which checks whether locally running envoy proxy is ready or not by calling http endpoint /ready on evoy admin URL. This is implemented for kubelet startup and liveness probes when consul-dataplane is registered as sidecar container.
